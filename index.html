            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>My name is Tommy and I am a Software Developer at Amazon. I attended Carnegie Mellon University majoring in Computer Science with a Minor in Game Design and another Minor in Social and Political History. 
			   I'm a self-proclaimed nerd and am interested in learning just about anything there is to know. I like Science and Math, but also love to learn about History, Language, and Literature. I am a
		    	   problem solver at heart and love a good challenge.<br><br>

			   In my free time, my passion is games. I love to play them, but especially to design and make my own. Ever since I was a kid, I've been trying to make games to impress my friends and have fun!
			   As I got older, I learned how to program computer games and haven't kicked the habit since. This website is meant in part as a space to showcase my projects- take a look!<br><br>
			   
			   <b>Favorite Video Games:</b> Sid Meier's Civilization, XCOM, Super Smash Brothers, FTL: Faster than Light, Fire Emblem, The Elder Scrolls, Slay the Spire <br>
			   
			   <b>Favorite Board Games:</b> Clank!, Avalon, Terraforming Mars, Dominion, Scrabble, Chess <br>
			   
			   <b>Favorite Sports:</b> Tennis, Soccer, Skiing <br><br>
			   
			   Also I am a huge fan of Magic: the Gathering!.<br>
			   
			   Will talk at length about any of the above and much more.

                  I took classes in Computer Science and Game Design, but also have taken electives in

			  At CMU I learned the value of hard work, but also made many lifelong friends and have excellent memories.

                  I graduated from the Pingry School with honors and won the Computer Science Award my senior year. For my academic achievement I was inducted to the Cum Laude society. I was a member of the Tennis team and

			  	After graduation, I joined Amazon full-time as a Software developer. My team has deployed numerous products, internal and external, that improve the data quality
				of products on amazon.com. I have personally contributed substantial code towards internal tools that are used by dozens of employees every day and handle Terrabytes of data.
				I have learned how to operationally support a tool that is live in production and how to quickly respond to user feedback.
				  
				In 2021 I was promoted to SDEII for my contributions. In 2023 I achieved a Patent for my contribution in "Schema Modeling".
			  </p>
				
			 <p>
				 At Amazon, I have had the opportunity to work with some incredibly brilliant people and learn new techniques and best practices every day. Amazon has given me tremendous opportunity
				 and during my time there I have gained exceptional engineering skills.

                  My first (and hopefully not my last!) foray into the game industry. I worked as an engineering intern on <a href="https://www.crashbandicoot.com/crashteamracing">Crash Team Racing</a>. I got to contribute real features and code that will ship with the game! I worked on a
				  wide variety of tasks including gameplay, graphics, and UI. If you've ever been hit by the sinister Warp Orb powerup, that was implemented by me! I also worked a little bit on the tools side. I learned version control
				  with Perforce as well as how to use JIRA for task tracking. This was an awesome experience for me and really confirmed how much I like working in the games industry.
				  I got to work collaboratively with many other talented individuals and I think I am a much better engineer coming out of the internship.

                  <p>
                  I attended a 12 week program taught at CMU's own Entertainment Technology Center. I learned how to make games using Unity, met with
				  industry professionals, and was instructed in the art of game design. I first developed a very well received individual project called
				  Forever Falling. Then I worked in larger team and developed Angry Beards, a parody on Angry Birds. Finally, in a three week large project,
				  I led a team of six to create the game Ulrich, in which you play as a deranged scientist protecting his inventions from the government.
				  
				  <br><br>
				  
				  Later, I returned to the NHSGA, but as a Teaching Assistant instead! I taught the class programming skills, Unity, and helped them
				  integrate their projects onto new platforms such as Mobile, the HTC Vive, Occulus Touch, and the ETC's Cave. I worked closely with the students to
				  help create fourteen different projects by the end of the program.

                  Dashbid is a start up in the advertising technology industry. Dashbid acts as a middleman between
				  internet publishers and advertisers. I worked as an intern for three months. During this time I learned
				  a considerable amount about web development and about the world of digital advertising. I helped compile valuable
				  data and perform analysis to demonstrate how well or poorly certain publishers were doing. I built several web tools
				  for internal use, including a tool for automatically converting URL macros into compatible forms and an onboarding
				  website for new recruits.

                  I worked as an instructor at a tech camp held in the Summer hosted by my high school. I built lesson plans and then taught

				  Among these were Unity, GameMaker, AppInventor, Alice, GameSalad, Python, and Lego Mindstorm.

				  <br>This was the second project developed by the Moon Bean team, as well as the first larger project (our first game was Duck Falls). The assignment was to, believe it or not,
				  "redesign Sudoku." While other teams took a more conventional approach (Sudoku + battleship or 2 player Sudoku), we decided to try something radically different. The game has a really interesting set
				  of mechanics, although is a bit hard to understand. I'm proud of this project because of how well we iterated on the game based on player feedback, making small but meaningful changes at each step which
				  dramatically improved the project.<br>

			      <h4>Operation HYPNOS</h4>
			      <p>A puzzler in which you assume the role of a hacker trying to stop a sinister government operation.
				  <br> This game was developed at the Global Game Jam 2018 in just 48 hours! I had an awesome team and we really clicked making this game. It's
				  impressively large for the time frame it was developed in and features extremely innovative game mechanics. It wasn't the best game for the showroom
				  floor because we'd have players play for an hour at a time! I'm proud of how this one turned out and it really is fun and interesting to play.
					This game was completed in Januaray 2018</p>
